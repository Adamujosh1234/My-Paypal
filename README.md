## Task
The Task for this project was to use any Machine Learning (ML) model of my choice to be able to accurately and precisely
identify fraudulent Transactions.

## Description
I have used a variety of machine learning models and python modules to achieve this. The modules i used are
listed below
1. matplotlib, seaborn and plotly modules for visualizations
2. pandas  and numpy modules for data wrangling or manipulations
3. sklearn modules for all machine learning models used in the project.
4. XGboost modules for the XGboostClassifier model.
5. warnings module for ignoring warnings in the project.
6. imbalanced module for handling imbalanced datasets
7. bayesian optimizier for optimization

## Installation
The Project does not need anyform of Installation, however, all the dependencies must be installed
before it can work as it should.

## Usage
The project has been done entirely in jupyter Notebook. While in jupyter Notebook, you can go to the 
`Menu` , click on `cells`, and then `run all cells`.
