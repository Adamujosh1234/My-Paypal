## Task
Our project's main objective was to employ a Machine Learning (ML) model to accurately detect fraudulent transactions.

## Description
To achieve this, we utilized various machine learning models and Python modules. The following modules were imported:

1. Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualizations.
2. Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling and manipulation.
3. Sklearn modules for implementing the machine learning models.
4. XGboost modules for the XGboostClassifier model.
5. Warnings module for handling and ignoring warnings.
6. Imbalanced module for dealing with imbalanced datasets.
7. Bayesian optimizer for optimization purposes.

## Installation
No specific installation is required for the project. However, it is essential to install all the necessary dependencies to ensure the project works correctly.

## Usage
This project was developed entirely within Jupyter Notebook. To execute it, simply open the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the "Menu" section, click on "Cells," and select "Run All Cells."
