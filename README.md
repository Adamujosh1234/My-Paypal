## Task
The central focus of this project revolved around carefully selecting and implementing a preferred Machine Learning (ML) model to achieve an exceptional level of precision and accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Description
For the successful realization of this project's goals, I extensively explored a diverse array of machine learning models and harnessed various Python modules. Among the imported modules, the following are listed to showcase the comprehensive approach undertaken.

1. Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualizations.
2. Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling and manipulation.
3. Sklearn modules for implementing the machine learning models.
4. XGboost modules for the XGboostClassifier model.
5. Warnings module for handling and ignoring warnings.
6. Imbalanced module for dealing with imbalanced datasets.
7. Bayesian optimizer for optimization purposes.

## Installation
No specific installation is required to make the project work aside from installing the necessary python modules. However, it is essential to install all the necessary dependencies to ensure the project works correctly.

## Usage
This project was developed entirely within Jupyter Notebook. To execute it, simply open the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the "Menu" section, click on "Cells," and select "Run All Cells" and wait patiently for the process to be completed.
