Welcome to My Paypal ML Fraud Detection Project!

Task:
Our project's main objective was to employ a Machine Learning (ML) model to accurately detect fraudulent transactions.

Description:
To achieve this, we utilized various machine learning models and Python modules. The following modules were imported:

- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualizations.
- Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling and manipulation.
- Sklearn modules for implementing the machine learning models.
- XGboost modules for the XGboostClassifier model.
- Warnings module for handling and ignoring warnings.
- Imbalanced module for dealing with imbalanced datasets.
- Bayesian optimizer for optimization purposes.

Installation:
No specific installation is required for the project. However, it is essential to install all the necessary dependencies to ensure the project works correctly.

Usage:
This project was developed entirely within Jupyter Notebook. To execute it, simply open the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the "Menu" section, click on "Cells," and select "Run All Cells."
